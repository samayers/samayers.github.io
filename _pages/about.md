Hi! I am a PhD student in Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley. My research interests include exploring the determinants of kindergarten readiness among low-income children, intergenerational economic mobility, and incentives for innovation in scientific publishing. I am currently a graduate student fellow at the California Policy Lab where I work with Professor Jesse Rothstein on exploring the educational impact of safety net access for California college students

Prior to coming to UC Berkeley, I worked on projects related to post-secondary readiness for rural high school students at the Center for Education Policy Research and on maternal and child health related RCTs at J-PAL. I have a B.A. in mathematical economics from Colorado College.
